# Gemma4-E2B RL Performance Report — TPU v7x (Ironwood) 4x4x4

Recorded 2026-08-18. All runs: gemma4-e2b (`google/gemma-4-E2B-it` lineage),
GRPO, MaxText+tunix+Pathways, 64-chip / 128-core-device 4x4x4 slice,
bf16 (no quantization), OpenMathInstruct-2. Full head logs:
`gs://alisachen/tpu_rl/ironwood/logs/`. Per-run artifacts (tensorboard,
phasetime JSONs, lendist, checkpoints): `gs://ubench-logs/alisachen-tpu7x/runs/<run>/`.

## Headline — decode-light regime (`g4dl`, GB200-matched invariants)

Full tianyu-rl-14 optimization stack (5 runtime patches + continue-decode
window 64 + sharded logprobs + `async_scheduling=False` + XLA proxy flags
@ scoped_vmem 65536 + compile cache), frozen invariants: 128 prompts × 8
generations = 1,024 completions, β=0, lr 5e-6, temp 0.7, top_k=-1,
format-only reward, caps 512/64, bf16, 20 steps.

| Metric (warm, steps ≥2, n=17) | Value |
|---|---|
| **Global (true-cycle) step time** | **floor 12.4 s · median 14.1 s** · mean 14.2 · max 16.9 |
| Generation phase (engine_generate) | floor 7.0 s · median 8.8 s |
| Rewards (format regex, warm) | 0.73 s |
| Train segment (128×8-microbatch GRPO update + push) | 4.3 s |
| Throughput | **4,635 tok/s** end-to-end · 7,481 tok/s generation-phase |
| Regime proof (LENDIST) | 99.4–100% of completions truncated at cap-64, osl_mean 64.0, isl_mean ~125 (prompt cap never binding) |
| Run health | 20/20 steps, exit 0, zero restarts; step 0 = 1442 s (one-time compiles), step 1 = 93 s (residual warmup), excluded per protocol |

### Vs the reference numbers (same true-cycle definition, same cap-64 batch shape)

| System | Step time | vs g4dl |
|---|---|---|
| **g4dl (this work)** | **14.1 s median** | — |
| GB200 64-GPU (TRL/vLLM colocate, pd=2, hard cap 64) | 122.8 s | **8.7× slower** |
| TPU v7x 64-chip decode-light baseline (94 s floor / 109 s median, ~235 tok/s, rollout ~78% dispatch-idle, pre-CD stack) | 109 s median | 7.7× slower · **~20× lower tok/s** (natural ~11-tok completions) |

Interpretation: the prior TPU baseline's own profiling attributed ~78% of its
rollout to Pathways dispatch idle; the continuous-batching decode window
(fused 64-iteration loop, zero per-token host round-trips) deletes almost all
of it. This is the tianyu qwen3 ladder's thesis transplanted to gemma4 and
amplified by the regime.

Honest caveats: datasets differ across all three systems (ours:
OpenMathInstruct-2; TPU baseline: ads-CTR "letter"; GB200: NuminaMath-CoT);
both references predate the CD/window stack; our sharded-logprobs path changes
the RNG stream by design (distributional, not bitwise, equivalence — LENDIST
band and format-reward sanity were the validity gates, both green).

## Decode-heavy baseline (`g4r0a`, no optimizations — the reference for the stack's value on the real workload)

R0 shape: 30 steps, batch 256×8 = 2,048 completions, 4096+4096 tokens, math
rewards, tmbs=1, CD disabled, no patches/flags. Preempted by Kueue at batch
17 (16 warm cycles captured — sufficient; protocol n≥15).

| Metric (warm, n=15–16) | Value |
|---|---|
| Global cycle | floor 438 s · **median 490 s** (upward drift: completion lengths grow as training progresses; last cycles ~660 s) |
| Rollout phase | floor 284 s · median 357 s (~70% of cycle → rollout-bound) |
| Train+weight-push serial segment | 131 s (extraordinarily stable, ±2 s; contains 256 grad-acc microbatches at tmbs=1) |
| Structure | near-pure serial on-policy: cycle ≈ rollout + train/push (no cross-step pipelining) |

## Perf-PR image A/B (`g4r0p`) — negative result, correctly diagnosed

`-perf` image (upstream PRs #3395/#3401/#1904 merged) with default config:
**no measurable change** (aligned batches 2–3: rollout 312/324 s vs baseline
284/317 s; train gap identical 131 s). Root cause: #3401 requires
`enable_continue_decode` (not set), #3395 requires the RPA env (not set) —
the PRs are activation-gated. This finding shaped the g4dl config, where the
same code, activated, delivered the headline above.

## Tuning probe ladder (in progress)

- **RPA block-size forwarding proven live** (#3395 path): probe g4p2's tuple
  was *rejected by the kernel's validator* (`bkv_sz % bkv_csz != 0`) — which
  only fires when the override reaches the kernel; g4p3 with `1,8704,1,2176`
  ran 2 clean decode-heavy steps. Constraint recorded: at kv=8704 the valid
  chunk ladder is {4352, 2176, 1088}. Phased-profile kernel-name verification
  pending (trace didn't flush in a 2-step probe — capture fix queued).
- Remaining rungs: no-env control at probe shape, bkv_csz 4352 vs 2176 vs
  default, `USE_BATCHED_RPA_KERNEL=1`, KV `block-size=256` (both from aysu's
  gemma4 serving config), dp32×tp4 vs dp16×tp8 (aysu evidence favors tp=4),
  tmbs=2 trainer scout, zero-weight-reward skip (~30 s/step cold observed),
  then the **decode-heavy stack run `g4r1`** vs g4r0a's 490 s median.

## Cost of measurement honesty (found and fixed along the way)

Cross-tenant Pathways head port collision (Fix #22), helm `workload.envs`
array replacement wiping ARTIFACT_DIR, launcher port overrides vs port-shifted
charts, kernel tuple divisibility, phased-profiler gs://-only requirement —
all recorded in RUNBOOK/repo for the next campaign.
